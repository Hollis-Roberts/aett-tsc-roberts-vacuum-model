# AETT/TSC Framework: The Roberts Vacuum Model

**Author:** Hollis Roberts  
**First published:** February 2026  
**DOI:** [To be assigned via Zenodo]

## Overview

The Accumulative Emergent Time Theory (AETT) proposes that time is not fundamental but emerges from the dynamics of a Timeless Sea Cosmology (TSC). The **Roberts Vacuum Model** refines this by positing that our universe is a **void** within the TSC, with gravity arising from external pressure on the void walls.

This repository contains the complete theoretical framework, mathematical derivations, testable predictions, and technological applications.

## Key Concepts

- **TSC Substrate:** A timeless, pressure-bearing medium
- **The Void:** Our universe as a region of reduced pressure
- **Gravity:** External pressure on the void walls
- **Dark Matter:** Entrained TSC fragments or wall thickness
- **Dark Energy:** Relaxation of the void walls

## Repository Structure

- `/theory` - Core theoretical documents and mathematical foundations
- `/predictions` - Testable experimental predictions
- `/applications` - Potential technological applications
- `/figures` - Diagrams and visual analogies
